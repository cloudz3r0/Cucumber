Maven is a build management tool that imports code from other creators.
A way to share code with people.
pom.xml contains all maven dependencies.
We get the maven dependencies from online maven repository.
<dependency>
        <groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
        <artifactId>cucumber-java</artifactId>
        <version>7.11.2</version>
    </dependency>Path of the dependency on the repository.

    this is an example.
    Kinda like a method but we dont need to call its object since its automatically imported
    into our project.
